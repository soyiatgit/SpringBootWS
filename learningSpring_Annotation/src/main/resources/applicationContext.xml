	<!-- as can be seen above a context namespace is required while using the Annotation with spring
	Once we have the context namespace in place, we can add the following tag -->
	
	<!-- the below tag tell spring that beans in this project is configured using Annotation -->
	<context:annotation-config />
	
	<!-- the below tag tells spring where to look for various annotated beans
	By default if you specify the base package, the entire project is scanned -->
	<context:component-scan base-package="com.customer" />
	
	<!-- nothing else needs to be done in this file. All beans are found using stereotype annotation
	@Component :used for models or dtos
	@Service : for business logic beans
	@Repository : for Data access beans
	All are same technically, The later two extends the @Componnet.
	Just use them semantically in correct places -->
